# polybar_scripts

<br>**Description**<br><br>
Dear friends and guests of my Github page,

here I will publish my own scripts for Polybar, which I use in conjunction with the tiling window manager i3.

Use them with caution, because unfortunately it is not always guaranteed that they work with other configurations than mine.

Some scripts (mostly written in Bash or Python) will require sudo rights (entry in /etc/sudoers) - this info will be explained in the respective README.

Please also note that the more permissions you give to different applications, the more insecure your operating system becomes overall, as it opens up vulnerable fields for potential attacks that were previously not possible.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
